Purpose: Enhance agricultural sustainability by providing accurate weather predictions.
Data Preparation:
Inspected and cleaned the dataset for anomalies and missing values.
Normalized and scaled features for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.
Addressed temporal dependencies using appropriate feature engineering techniques.
Data Splitting:
Split the dataset into training (70%) and test (30%) subsets.
Used random seeds for reproducibility and ensured that the temporal structure was preserved during the split.
2. Models Evaluated
The study evaluated eight ML and DL models to capture the dataset's complex patterns:

Random Forest Regressor (RFR): Best-performing model, demonstrating robustness and precision in handling non-linear data relationships.
Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR): Excelled at minimizing large prediction errors.
Linear Regression (LR): Simplicity led to higher error metrics in this context.
Support Vector Regressor (SVR): Struggled with non-linear dependencies and high variability.
Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost): Moderate performance, with limited effectiveness on temporal data.
Deep Learning (DL) Models: Underperformed due to overfitting challenges and limited dataset size.
3. Model Training and Evaluation
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Optimized hyperparameters for each model using GridSearchCV.
Example parameters tuned:
RFR: Number of estimators, maximum depth, and minimum samples split.
GBR: Learning rate, number of estimators, and loss function.
Evaluation Metrics:
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): To capture sensitivity to large prediction errors.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): To measure average prediction deviation.
Comparison of metrics across models revealed strengths and limitations.
Results:
Random Forest Regressor (RFR):
Lowest RMSE and MAE scores.
Highly effective for agricultural applications like planting, irrigation, and harvesting.
Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR):
Strong performance, particularly in minimizing large errors.
Deep Learning Models:
